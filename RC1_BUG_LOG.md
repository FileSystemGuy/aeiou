# Release-candidate 1 review: bug log

Append-only. One entry per bug, written only once its fix is verified (a test that fails
without the fix and passes with it, or the command output before and after), and committed and
pushed together with that fix.
The review started at tag `pre-rc1-review` (644006e, 2026-10-14); `aeiou-datagen`, the
deprecated Python writer, is out of scope. Each entry: where, how it was found, what was wrong,
the fix, the evidence, and the commit, so the work can be replayed from the tag.

## 1. The description's percentile range printed inverted under a clamp

- **Where:** `builder/aeiou/describe.py`, `Describer._dist` and `_clamp` (the prose of a
  `normal` or `lognormal` with `min`/`max`).
- **Found by:** review of the Python tools (aeiou-catalog describe), checking the percentile
  prose against the runner's sampling in `runner/aeiou/src/eval.rs` (`clamp`: raise to `min`,
  then lower to `max`, every draw).
- **Defect:** the 5th percentile was clamped only by `min` and the 95th only by `max`, so a
  bound past both percentiles inverted the range: `normal(1000, 10, max=500)` printed "5th–95th
  percentile 984 bytes to 500 bytes"; `lognormal(100, 1, min=1000)` printed "1,000 bytes to 518
  bytes". The runner draws 500 (resp. 1,000) every time.
- **Fix:** `_clamp` applies both bounds to each percentile in the runner's order; when the two
  rendered percentiles coincide the prose says the value once ("5th and 95th percentiles both
  500 bytes"). Prose only: no AST, fingerprint, or committed DESCRIPTION.md changed
  (`aeiou-catalog check --no-shapes`: ok).
- **Evidence:** `builder/tests/test_describe.py::test_a_clamp_past_both_percentiles_moves_both`
  fails on the old describe.py and passes on the new; test_catalog.py + test_describe.py: 49
  passed.

## 2. `aeiou datagen` asked for free space before refusing a corpus it would refuse anyway

- **Where:** `runner/aeiou/src/datagen.rs`, `datagen()`: the order of the space check
  (`check_space`, DESIGN_REVIEW §3.74 item 4) and the structural refusals.
- **Found by:** the baseline coverage run (`cargo llvm-cov --features formats,object`): the
  test `object::object_names_need_object_endpoints` failed on this host ("space: dataset(s)
  `pq`: 29.80 GiB to write, 20.68 GiB free: the corpus does not fit") where it expected the
  `array`-in-an-object-store refusal. The test passes or fails with the host's free disk.
- **Defect:** the space check, which asks the file system, ran before the refusals the
  abstract, parameters, and endpoints decide alone (a resumed corpus's format writer, an
  `array` dataset in an object store, V18), so a datagen that would be refused anyway told the
  user to free tens of GiB first.
- **Fix:** the per-dataset loop is split: a first pass resolves each dataset's writer, root, and
  endpoint and makes the structural refusals; then rank 0's space check; then the plan (empty
  roots, directories, this rank's share). Nothing is created before either check, as before.
  `aeiou run` was checked for the same ordering defect: its storage-dependent checks already
  come after the decidable ones. runner/REFERENCE.md §5 *Space* updated.
- **Evidence:** the test now also runs the refused datagen with the posix dataset grown to 888
  PiB (`--param pq_code=1000000000`), which fits on no host: without the fix "space: … 888.18
  PiB to write … does not fit", with it the `array` refusal and no `space:` line. `cargo test
  --features formats --test all`: 75 passed; `--features formats,object` with MinIO: 79 passed.
